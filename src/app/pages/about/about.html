            Given the Covid-19 pandemic and following the lift of the ban on International travels a lot of hospitals in Africa have run into the problems of shortage in Equipment and support Staff. 
            This dApp which will be built on ElastOS is a dApp which has Hospitals and Users. A Hospital will upload it's needs. The needs of the Hospital may be equipment or funding. 
            A User can then decide to donate to a Hospital in Africa or Volunteer to work at the Hospital. Users can also vote for the needs of a Hospital for the Hospital to rise to the top of the feed.

            For the Hackathon, the MVP of the App will be built. The MVP will have the following features:

            I have experience building on the ElastOs platfrom and grateful for to the experience contributing. Thank you.
            
            Upon completion of the Hackathon, I look forward to partnering with relevant organizations to bring the idea to life. 
            Such organizations include Hospitals, NGOs in the Healthcare space and HealthTech startups. 
            These bodies can leverage on the Tech to pitch their problems and thus guarantee their credibility.
